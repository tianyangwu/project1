    <h1>I DO</h1>
      <h2><a href="http://colbiecaillat.com/">Colbie Caillat</a></h2>

    <p>It's always been about me, myself, and I<br>
      I thought relationships were nothing but a waste of time<br>
      I never wanted to be anybody's other half<br>
      I was happy saying I had a love that wouldn't last<br>
      That was the only way I knew 'til I met yo</p>

    <p>You make me wanna say<br>
      I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do<br>
      Yeah, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do<br>
      'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no<br>
      I can live without it, I can let it go<br>
      Ooh what did I get myself into?<br>
      You make me wanna say<br>
      I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do</p>
    <img src="image/2.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" alt="pink love 2"<br>

    <p>Tell me is it only me<br>
      Do you feel the same?<br>
      You know me well enough to know that I'm not playing games<br>
      I promise I won't turn around and I won't let you down<br>
      You can trust I've never felt it like I feel it now<br>
      Baby, there's nothing, there's nothing we can't get through</p>

    <p>So can we say<br>
      I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do<br>
      Oh, baby, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do<br>
      'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no<br>
      I won't live without it, I won't let it go<br>
      What more can I get myself into?<br>
      You make me wanna say</p>

    <p>Meet my family, how's your family?<br>
      Ooh, can we be a family?<br>
      And when I'm eighty years old and I'm sitting next to you</p>

    <p>And we'll remember when we said<br>
      I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do<br>
      Oh, baby, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do<br>
      'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no<br>
      No, I won't live without it, I won't let us go<br>
      Just look at what we got ourselves into<br>
      You make me wanna say<br>
      I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do<br>
      Love you</p>
